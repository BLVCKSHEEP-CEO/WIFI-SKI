# WIFI-SKI
## WHAT IS THE WIFI-SKI

It is basically a home-built version of an rc jetski using esp 32 and some arduino modules.

During summer clean up I found this old jetski in my closet and decided to upgrade it to fit this era. I also had some spare sensors, so with what I had, I decided to make a jetski controlled via a website over a wifi network.

## HOW TO USE

In order to use it, one must turn it on using the toggle switch and connect to the wifi network it creates using a mobile phone or any compatible device.

From there, there are basic controls that are represented by the arrow keys in the direction you want to maneuver

## WHY I MADE IT

I recently got the hobby of homelabbing and just love to put my skills to the 
test, plus I decided to make it a birthday gift for him
